<p><strong>The Waveguide Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Band Pass</li><li>High Pass</li><li>Low Pass</li><li>Notched</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Waveguide filters are crucial components in microwave and RF applications, categorized primarily into four types based on their frequency response. Band Pass filters allow a specific frequency range to pass while blocking others, making them ideal for communication systems. High Pass filters enable frequencies above a certain threshold to pass, useful for eliminating low-frequency noise. Low Pass filters block high frequencies, ensuring signal integrity. Notched filters, on the other hand, selectively attenuate a specific frequency band, effectively filtering out unwanted signals.</p></p>
