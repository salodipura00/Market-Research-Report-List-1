<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Water Mist Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Nozzles</li><li>Closed Nozzles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Pressure Water Mist Systems are advanced fire suppression technologies categorized mainly into two types: open nozzles and closed nozzles. Open nozzle systems discharge water mist continuously, suitable for areas requiring constant protection without specific activation triggers. In contrast, closed nozzle systems release mist only when a fire is detected, providing targeted protection and minimizing water damage. Both systems effectively cool and displace oxygen around a fire, enhancing safety while conserving water compared to traditional sprinkler systems.</p></p>
