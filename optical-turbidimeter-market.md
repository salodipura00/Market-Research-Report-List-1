<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Turbidimeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scattered Light Turbidimeter</li><li>Transmitted Light Turbidimeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical turbidimeter market primarily features two types: scattered light turbidimeters and transmitted light turbidimeters. Scattered light turbidimeters measure turbidity by detecting light scattered at specific angles from particles in a sample, making them suitable for low-turbidity applications. In contrast, transmitted light turbidimeters assess turbidity by measuring the light that passes through the sample, ideal for high-turbidity conditions. Both types find applications across industries such as water treatment, food and beverage, and environmental monitoring, ensuring effective quality control.</p></p>
